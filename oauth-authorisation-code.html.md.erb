## <a id='overview'></a> OAuth Authorization Code

**Note: The Swisscom OAuth is only usable if it is approved and granted from the API team - contact us via the [contact form](https://developer.swisscom.com/support)**

This tutorial describes an easy way to get an OAuth authorization code & access token and shows the integration flow.

Tools:

* Google Chrome
* Modify Headers Plugin for google Chrome
* Localhost (How to setup a localhost on Windows)

### 1. Get OAuth Authorization Code

Open this URL in your browser - you need a valid client id.
```
https://consent.swisscom.com/c/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&client_id=%YOUR_CLIENT_ID%&lang=en
```

You will see the Swisscom login

#### 2. Login with given Swisscom credentials

The user has to login with his Swisscom Credentials (username & password).

#### 3. Consent Page - Authorise

After login successfully a consent page appears with a request to agree that this page/app has the permission to read the users information.

It has to be configured with the API engineers what kind of information can be asked for, example: scope=read-basicprofile, read-birthdate etc. The browser redirects to the redirect URL (of step1) after confirming the consent page.
The consent page will only appear if it was configured with an API engineer before. Otherwise the browser redirects to the redirect URL (of step1) directly.

#### 4. You will be redirected to: ```https://localhost/?code=5du16Pu6&scope=...```

#### 5. Extract the code parameter

In this Example it is “5du16Pu6”

#### 6. Get the OAuth Token

##### a) Set the Authorization header in Browser: ```Authorization: Basic %YOUR_CLIENT_ID%:%YOUR_CLIENT_ID_SECRET%(As BASE64) (OAuth)``` and enabled it

##### b) Get the token, by calling the URL:

```
https://consent.swisscom.com/o/oauth2/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code=5du16Pu6&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost 
```

You should see the token in the JSON response.

NOTE: If you see 401 with “INVALID_AUTHENTICATION_CREDENTIALS” make sure that you set and enabled the Authentication header, see step (a).

##### c) extract the token

In this example the token is: “kVhlBP24TjemCzvmSxSvkpa6ZUwv”

#### 7) Now you are ready to call an API that needs an OAuth Token

As example: User Profile API as curl call

```
curl -ik  -H "Authorization: Bearer kVhlBP24TjemCzvmSxSvkpa6ZUwv" -X GET "https://api.swisscom.com/v1/users/~/profile"
```
